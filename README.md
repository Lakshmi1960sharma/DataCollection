# Find the duplicates or almost similar images from the given dataset 

* Python code to find and remove the non essential data is available in the unique_images notebook 

* I have used imaging_interview_exp.py where in the 'compare_frames_change_detection' function return the score, res_cnts, thresh,frame_delta,cnts
* if the score is less than 5000 then its decided to be the similar image and image is removed
